# ChatMD
Convert ChatGPT to Markdown (.md) while preserving syntax (e.g. code formatting). Done in Javascript and Python. The majority of the Python script was done by converting the script written in Javascript with ChatGPT to Python.

## Javascript
1. Navigate to the shared chat url.
2. Copy the JS code from `extract_md_from_ChatGPT.js`  to the code snippet's tab on Chrome or paste it directly to the console.
3. Run the snippet (or the code copied on the console).
4. Copy the output of the console.
5. Paste it where you desire!

## Python
1. Install required libraries (`beautifulsoup4` and `requests`).
2. Update URL on line 48.
3.  Run the script.
4.  Review the content on the console or in the `output.md` file.
